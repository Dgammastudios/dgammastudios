          </h2>
          <p>
            Hello! Welcome to the chaos that is my brain. I love people and I love art. And, I absolutely love the
            endless
            creative world that lives between people and art.
            I've spent most of my time in the audio world investigating ways to use my love of audio to make your day a
            little better. I've helped several musicians write songs, I've helped even more musicians host shows, and
            I've
            worked to build my own recording studio and arsenal of audio equipment to keep on empowering musicians. I've
            also delved into photography, videography, front end design, tech, and so many other things. Check out some
            of
            my projects around the website! I hope you enjoy your time here!

          <br>
          <p>
            I started dabbling in live sound when I was 16. My high school choral director sold our 1970's peavey powered mixer and two beat up speakers. After that, I started DJing, I picked up a Mackie VLZ 1604, and I ran sound for a few friends putting on some small shows. I continued building sound equipment until my current system, which can service 400 people for a rock show. I've always been facinated by audio quality and considering doing this as a side gig, I feel I've build one of the best sounding audio systems in it's price range.

          <br>
          <p>
       Story time! In college, I asked myself, "What work would have the biggest positive impact on my and my neighbors day to day lives?" I settled on two things. 1. More contact with people would open up doors for more friendships and more support. 2. The arts. I decided that since I already had a background in music and an interest in audio quality, I could go ahead and try to make a positive contribution through audio work. So I started building a recording studio, studying, and practicing as much as I could.</p>

            The rest of the studio - I like to learn. I started learning photography and photo editing. Then I started learning a little graphic design (my wife, featured above, is so much better than me at that, so she told me how to design this site and I coded it). Then I started studying HTML and CSS. Then I tried learning some videography. Then I built a computer. Then I got a monitor color calibrator. Then I played a lot of very beautiful looking video games on my calibrated 99.9% sRGB monitor. Then I got better soldering equipment for making electrical component repairs. Then I got a 3D printer. Then I got a good deal on a DJI drone. Then I used the internets to learn some electrical engineering and built a new curcuit in a tube mic.
