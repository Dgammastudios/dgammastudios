          <p>
            Hello and welcome to my studio! My name is Isaac, and I love how music balances between art and science. It's an endless creative world that can bring life to our everyday lives. I'm sure most people would agree that a constructive culture is a strong culture. I believe a major aspect of art's purpose is to nourish constructive aspects of life, like friendships, emotional processing, and personal growth, for some general examples. So, I've decided to focus on nourishing culture through art. Thank you for joining me to build a studio that celebrates, mourns, learns, and grows.

            In high school around 2015 I managed to get a good deal on a working 1980s PA system. Several years later, I found myself DJing weddings and running sound for my church. After graduating with my B.S. in Psychology, I landed a job as the lead audio engineer for a church and moved from DJing to helping artists host shows and perfrom some of their original music.

            <p>
              When I was in college, I asked myself, "How can I make the biggest positive impact on the world around me?" I decided that I was best equipped in music.  So, as much as I could, I started building equipment for a music studio and studying and practicing mixing and producing. This is my main project, and I have continued building my stuido and skills for the past 5 years.

            I've gained most of my experience in music, but I love hunting for new experiences and skills. It's expecially satisfying when I'm able to learn something technical to improve how an evironment nurtures creativity. In case you're interested in my journey or methods, I'm building this portfolio with some art projects, some technical projects, and some research.
