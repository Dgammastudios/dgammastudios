    <h2>D'gamma - Your Wedding DJ</h2>
    <p>What's a celebration without good music? Your big day is getting closer,
      and you can't wait to celebrate the love of your life. Honestly, I can't wait for your big day either.
      Theres just something about marriage that makes me want to celebrate! But more than that,
      I want your celebration to be as full and as stress free as possible!
      I have experience. I'm organized. I play your music, or I can help create playlists if you need some help.
      Your music. Your celebration. I donâ€™t want you to have to worry about the music on your big day. Instead,
      I want to do what I know how to do to celebrate you and your spouses happy day!</p>
