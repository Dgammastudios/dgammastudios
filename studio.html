              Welcome to my studio! I've been building skills and my equipment
              collection for years. When I was about 14 years old, I mounted a
              speaker and battery powered amplifier into a backpack and started
              making beats on iMaschine on an iPod. Now, I run a professionally
              equipped and fully capable studio.
              <br />
              <br />
              I mix primarily in the box with plugins from some of the best
              brands, including Waves, Brainworx, Melodyne, and Black Rooster
              Audio. I have plugins of sounds that have made their way to
              countless platinum records, including Neve's 1073 and 1084 channel
              strips, SSL's 9000 J console, the gold standard 1176 and LA-2A
              compressors, and much more. My hardware highlights a dozen mics,
              including a modded large diaphram tube mic (check it out below), a
              Beyerdynamic M 201 TG (a detailed a clear dynamic mic for vocals,
              voiceovers, and instruments), a tube channel strip for that
              coveted warm sound, and more. I also have several virtual
              instruments, including Synthmaster 2, studio quality sampled
              pianos, orchestral instruments, drum kits, UJam's Carbon (virtual
              guitarist), UJam's Rowdy (virtual bassist), and more!
              <br />

              energetic and clean recordings, and my monitors and subwoofer are
              calibrated and opimally placed for the best mixing environment.
              Welcoming and comfortable, I've done my best to turn D'gamma
              Studios into a space for creative expression and for an immersive
              experience.

            <b>Modded Large Diaphram Condenser Tube Mic</b>
            <br />
            In my studio, this wonderful mic is the centerpiece. The mods improved the warmth of the mic,
            improved it's frequency response, and reduced noise. It hosts the
            same 6072 type vacuum tube found in mics like the Telefunken Ela M
            251, and it has a 32mm capsule with the same style as the Neve U67.
            The result is a warm, detailed mic, with an incredibly smooth frequency
            response, a beautiful richness, and a hint of air.

            <h4 class="text">First Ridgeland Christmas 2021</h4>
            <p class="text">
              I had the honor of mixing the Christmas songs for First Ridgeland
              Baptist Church in 2021. We recorded everything like it was live,
              with about 3 takes for each song. We recorded half the songs on
              Monday, the other half on Wednesday, and I finished mixing by that
              Friday night so we could send it in to run on local TV! This
              project was rushed and recorded live, and it marks one of my steps
              transitioning from working as a live sound engineer into the world
              of the recording studio.

          </h4>
          <p class="text">


             This was my first time mixing the Christmas songs for First Ridgeland Bapist Church. Again, we recorded like it was live on Monday and Wednesday, with about 3 takes per song. The mixing and mastering steps were also rushed and turned in by that Saturday. I believe that the difference in quality between this and the next years production are solid testaments to the effort I put into honing my skills.

            While I'm not currently advertising myself as a producer, I do have
            experience in songwriting and sound design. I've played drums since
            I was probably 9 years old, and I love translating musicality and
            expression into sample based drum kits. I can also play piano, know
            a good amount of music theory, and design my own synths, synth
            basses, and 808 sounds. I made the following track for fun several
            years ago using my piano plug-ins, synths, and a drum sampler.
