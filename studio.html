      Welcome to my studio! I've been building skills and my equipment collection for years. I got my start when I was about 14 years old. I mounted a speaker and battery powered amplifier into a backpack and started making beats on iMaschine on an iPod. After drumming for years at churches and Lake Forest Ranch, I started putting back money to get a little professional audio interface, a little midi keyboard, an Audio Technica AT2020 cardioid condenser microphone (this same model was used on a few Billie Eilish hits), and a pair of Audio Technica m50x studio headphones. I now have a 16-channel Presonus 16.4.2 soundboard, a Tascam US 16x08 audio interface, a custom modded tube mic (maybe similar to a C12, but also nothing sounds like a C12 except for a C12), almost a dozen other microphones, outboard gear, Presonus Eris E5 xt studio monitors, a desktop and laptop picked for processing speed to run my plethora of plugins with inaudible latency, and a lot more ear training and experience under my belt. Now that I feel like I can make music up to par with my expectations, I'm taking even bigger steps to grow my studio so I can find artists to help thrive in creativity.

            First Ridgeland Christmas 2021

          </h4>
          <p class="text">


             I had the honor of mixing the Christmas songs for First Ridgeland Baptist
            Church. We recorded everything like it was live, with about 3 takes for each song. We recorded half the
            songs on Monday, the other half on Wednesday, and I finished mixing by that Friday night so we could send it
            in to run on local TV! That was a very busy week.

            First Ridgeland Christmas 2020

          </h4>
          <p class="text">


             This was my first time mixing the Christmas songs for First Ridgeland Bapist Church. Again, we recorded like it was live on Monday and Wednesday, with about 3 takes per song. It was finished and turned in by that Saturday. I believe difference in quality between this and the next years production are solid testaments to the effort I put into honing my skills.
