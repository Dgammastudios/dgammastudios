        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing there, I watched as four 20 years old students encouraged the fourth-grade girl. They told her she could make it! One student, Alicia, tried to help by wrapping her arms around the little girl&rsquo;s legs and lifting, as to take some of the weight off her arms. But the little girl could not, as hard as she tried, she couldn&rsquo;t make it to the second rung on her own, or the third rung with help. She gave up on the monkey bars, but the students had not given up on her yet. They told her, &ldquo;Next time you&rsquo;ll make it! It&rsquo;s ok you couldn&rsquo;t make it across this time.&rdquo; When I noticed her crying at the top of the playground, next to the slide, I went to comfort her. She said she was upset because everyone kept telling her she could make it across the monkey bars, but that she didn&rsquo;t believe she could. I told her we all have our talents, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should give up where we are weak. While she should make the best of what comes easiest, she could also work extra on her weak sides, then she could take on the world. Minutes later, I saw her on the monkey bars, no one around, already halfway across. Some seven rungs down she slipped and fell, brushed off her hands and knees, and went to try again. In just a few weeks, crossing the monkey bars came with ease. But why couldn&rsquo;t she make it half way across the first time? How did she convince herself she could not?
        </p>
        <p>People deny reality all the time. Terrible opera singer Florence Foster Jenkins seemingly went to her death bed believing she was a marvelous vocalist.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a> Cancer patients sometimes deny being on the brink of death. An old lady was convinced a lump in her breast, a massive tumor, was not important enough to see a doctor about.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[ii]</a> These stories all have at least one thing in common, a belief and an effect. Of the beliefs, some effects were beneficial, others were harmful. In either case, all the people were convinced their current belief was the best. They continued denying the reality of their situations unless changing their beliefs looked better than keeping the perspective they had.</p>
        <p>One possible explanation for the actions of the people above is that their chosen perspective had the lowest perceived consequence and the highest perceived reward.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a> The girl trying to make her way across the monkey bars had to change her perspective of herself. To change her self-image from &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not strong enough&rdquo; to &ldquo;I can get stronger&rdquo; was at first of high consequence as change is an inconvenience to people.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a> Now, if she did not have the ability to cross the monkey bars, then her denial that she could cross would save her time and effort. Denial can prevent us from certain accomplishments, but it can also protect us from the consequences of an unchangeable and negative situation.<sup>iii</sup> The irony of denial is that what is supposed to protect us from certain negative consequences sometimes prevents us from getting out of that negative situation.<sup>ii</sup> This is most likely because we only like to risk change when the chances of good change are high. But while we are all motived by avoiding consequences and increasing rewards, our motivations for change can sometimes be based on perspective rather than reality. <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[v]</a> The girl who couldn&rsquo;t make it across the monkey bars perceived she could not make it across, but she could, as proven later.</p>
        <p>Now, helping people achieve is a good thing, and one way to help others achieve is by encouraging honesty with oneself. However, showing someone where they are being dishonest with themselves might just have the opposite effects of helping. People need information about the reality of a situation and time to consider where they might be wrong; calling out where they are wrong for them might just prevent them from thinking about anything except how they are could possibly be right.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[vi]</a> This is one of the barriers people easily build between trying to better their situation and staying where they are &ndash; refusing to contemplate if trying to better their situation is worth it.</p>
        Back to the initial examples, self-deception and perspectives can have a wide range of effects. While it might seem harmful to convince oneself that a bad situation is fine, it can provide an easier living experience. But often enough, being honest and attempting to make oneâ€™s own situation better usually has the best effect.ii The girl on the monkey bars saw herself as unable to make it across until strengthening where she was weak sounded better than giving up trying. Despite not having practiced yet, the changed mindset allowed her to achieve something that before seemed impossible. The old lady with the tumor, however, has a sadder story of denial. She avoided some of the mental consequences of having breast cancer by covering up the evidence, by not initially seeking or later receiving help, even after seeing a doctor. She did not avoid the physical consequences and passed away soon after getting diagnosed with cancer and refusing treatment.ii The opera singer, Florence Foster Jenkins, is an interesting story; she built her identity around being an amazing vocalist. and changing her identity was too high a consequence. She was never on pitch and even went to her deathbed acknowledging that many said she had no talent, but not accepting their claims. Performing in Carnegie Hall, her career was even highly successful.i In an observational study of cancer patients, those in denial reported feeling better, mentally and physically, than those who accepted their dire situation. The difference between these patients and the old lady before: these patients were receiving treatment. However, denial while receiving treatment had no change in the survivability of the cancer.ii So, denial seems to have helped everyone above avoid the consequences of acknowledging a negative situation, but prevented some of them from improving their own situation.
      	It is possible to overcome harmful denial. Cortney Warren, award winning psychotherapist, highly encourages people to be honest with themselves. Her formula for identifying self-deception is to stop and think. If someone notices an inconsistency between their beliefs and their actions, they are probably lying to themselves. If they realize they are, they should merely choose to be honest with themselves. However, it is often painful to be honest with oneself. Admitting we were wrong and that we are the ones that need to change rubs against the very nature of man. But, once aware of self-deception, we are more responsible for the consequences of our actions. Choosing to continue ignoring our need to change is no oneâ€™s fault but our own. When we lie to ourselves about situations we could make better, we hurt ourselves and often enough, those around us.  The fourth-grade girl crossing the monkey bars chose to be honest with herself. She accepted that even though she was not as strong as some of the others, she could work and get better.
